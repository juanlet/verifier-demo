# Validation Form

This form validates from highest priority to lowest different requirements. The user needs to fullfil all of them for identity validation.

## Live Demo


## Run tests
Vitest test runner and react testing library have been used to create the test suites for the react components that are part of this project

```
npm run test
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

Output files will be placed at **dist** directory(root level). Those files can be deployed to a cloud service of your choice. This build produces ES3 javascript code intentionally to give support for older browsers, and in that way, increase the reach of the application.
